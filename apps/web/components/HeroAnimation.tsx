/**
 * HeroAnimation Component
 * 
 * PHASE 3 PLACEHOLDER
 * 
 * This component will integrate react-three-fiber for a 3D geometric animation.
 * The animation will feature:
 * - Floating geometric shapes (polygons, icosahedrons)
 * - Subtle rotation and movement
 * - Network of connecting lines reacting to cursor movement
 * - Blue gradient lighting (#0076D1) with reflections
 * - Orbs of light moving through shapes symbolizing data flow
 * - Transparent background with white/gray base
 * - 60fps performance target with graceful degradation on mobile
 * 
 * Technology Stack (Phase 3):
 * - three.js
 * - @react-three/fiber
 * - @react-three/drei
 * 
 * Implementation will use dynamic imports for performance optimization
 * and will include fallback for devices with limited GPU capabilities.
